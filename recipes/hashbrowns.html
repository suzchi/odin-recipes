        <h1>Hashbrowns</h1>
            <p>A crispy hashbrown recipe. Serves 2.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>2 russet potatoes, peeled</li>
                <li>3 tablespoons butter</li>
                <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
                <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper, or to taste</li>
                <li>1 pinch paprika, or to taste</li>
            </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Shred potatoes into a large bowl filled with cold water. 
                    Stir until water is cloudy, drain, and cover potatoes 
                    again with fresh cold water. Stir again to dissolve 
                    excess starch. Drain potatoes well, pat dry with 
                    paper towels, and squeeze out any excess moisture.</li>
                <li>Heat butter in a large pan over medium heat. Sprinkle 
                    shredded potatoes into the hot butter and season with
                     salt, black pepper, cayenne pepper, and paprika.</li>
                <li>Cook potatoes until a brown crust forms at the bottom,
                     about 5 minutes. Continue to cook and stir until 
                     potatoes are browned over, about 5 more minutes.</li>
            </ol>
